# Research Paper Section Organization

This directory contains the individual sections of the research paper, designed to be written independently and later assembled.

## File Structure

1. **01-problem-formulation.md** - Mathematical problem formulation showing enterprise workflows as Petri net problems
2. **02-empirical-validation.md** - Empirical evidence of AI agent failure modes in traditional systems
3. **03-mathematical-solution.md** - Petri net extensions and mathematical framework for AI navigation
4. **04-implementation-validation.md** - Prototype implementation and performance measurement
5. **05-generalizability.md** - Domain boundaries and solution applicability analysis
6. **06-conclusion.md** - Synthesis and future research directions

## Assembly Instructions

Each section is designed to:
- Stand alone as a coherent unit
- Connect logically to adjacent sections
- Use paragraphic writing with minimal lists
- Include relevant mathematical formulations
- Provide empirical evidence where applicable

The final paper will be assembled by concatenating these sections with appropriate transitions.
