# TODO: Semantic Petri Net Research Paper

## High Priority

### 1. Add concrete example to Introduction
- [ ] Fill in the TODO showing painful AI agent reality
- [ ] Make the phone tree example more vivid and relatable
- [ ] Show actual tool call sequences that frustrate users

### 2. Create visual diagrams for FSM vs Petri net comparison
- [ ] Side-by-side comparison diagram
- [ ] Show why FSM approach fails
- [ ] Illustrate multi-entry advantages

### 3. Expand Petri net primer
- [ ] Simple, accessible explanation for non-CS readers
- [ ] Visual examples with circles, rectangles, dots
- [ ] Real-world analogy (traffic, manufacturing, etc.)

### 4. Expand Theory-Practice Bridge section
- [ ] Concrete examples of how Petri net theory explains our success
- [ ] Map specific implementation patterns to theoretical concepts
- [ ] Show why the accidental alignment matters

## Medium Priority

### 5. Add state explosion problem diagrams
- [ ] Show exponential growth of states in FSM
- [ ] Contrast with Petri net's linear growth
- [ ] Use Targetprocess workflow as example

### 6. Add token flow diagrams
- [ ] Show multiple tokens in different places
- [ ] Illustrate concurrent workflow execution
- [ ] Developer working on multiple tasks example

### 7. Expand formal verification section
- [ ] What properties could be mathematically proven
- [ ] Tools that could analyze our workflows
- [ ] Benefits for enterprise adoption

### 8. Include FSM limitations appendix
- [ ] Research findings on FSM failures
- [ ] Industry evidence and case studies
- [ ] Academic support for our discoveries

### 9. Add more code examples
- [ ] Pull real code from git history
- [ ] Show evolution of semantic hints
- [ ] Include role-based adaptation examples

### 10. Polish narrative flow
- [ ] Ensure smooth transitions between sections
- [ ] Check for repetition or gaps
- [ ] Strengthen the story arc

## Lower Priority

### 11. Create interactive elements specs
- [ ] Define what interactivity would show
- [ ] Mockups or detailed descriptions
- [ ] Implementation notes for web version

### 12. Consider sections directory structure
- [ ] Break into separate files if needed
- [ ] Create assembly script
- [ ] Maintain single file for now?

## Notes

- Keep the honest, discovery-based narrative
- Use real examples from the implementation
- Don't oversell or make up data
- Let the genuine insights shine through
