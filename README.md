# Semantic Petri Net Pattern Discovery

This repository documents the discovery of Petri net patterns while building the Targetprocess MCP Server, and demonstrates why traditional AI agents struggle with enterprise workflows.

## Overview

While building a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Targetprocess, we discovered that semantic hints and multi-entry workflows naturally align with Petri net theory. This explains why FSM-based AI agents fail at complex workflows - they're using the wrong computational model.

## Key Findings

1. **Semantic hints pattern** reduces navigation complexity by 80-90%
2. **Multi-entry workflows** eliminate hierarchical navigation overhead
3. **Petri net patterns** naturally emerge when building workflow tools
4. **FSM limitations** are architectural, not implementation-specific

## Quick Start

To run the comparison test:

```bash
cd simulator
./setup.sh        # Install dependencies
./run-test.sh     # Run performance comparison
```
