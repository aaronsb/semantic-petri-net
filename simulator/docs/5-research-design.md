# Research Design and Methodology

Academic framework for comparing FSM and Petri net navigation approaches.

## Research Questions

### Primary Question
**RQ1**: How does the choice of navigation paradigm (FSM vs Petri net) affect the efficiency of AI agents in enterprise workflow systems?

### Secondary Questions
- **RQ2**: What types of workflow operations benefit most from Petri net patterns?
- **RQ3**: How does workflow complexity affect the efficiency gap between approaches?
- **RQ4**: Can semantic operations compensate for hierarchical navigation overhead?

## Hypotheses

### H1: Efficiency Hypothesis
Petri net navigation will require fewer tool calls than FSM navigation for identical workflow goals, with an expected efficiency gain of 2-5x.

### H2: Complexity Scaling Hypothesis
The efficiency gap between approaches will increase with workflow complexity:
- Simple workflows (1-2 states): 2x improvement
- Standard workflows (4-5 states): 3x improvement  
- Complex workflows (6+ states): 4-5x improvement

### H3: Operation Type Hypothesis
Different operation types will show varying efficiency gains:
- State transitions: 4x improvement (navigation elimination)
- Reassignments: 3x improvement (direct access)
- Bulk operations: 5x+ improvement (concurrent execution)

## Experimental Design

### Independent Variables
1. **Navigation Paradigm**: FSM vs Petri net
2. **Dataset Complexity**: Test, Standard, Chaos
3. **Operation Type**: Transition, Completion, Reassignment
4. **Test Scale**: Number of operations (5-100)

### Dependent Variables
1. **Tool Call Count**: Primary efficiency metric
2. **Success Rate**: Percentage of completed operations
3. **Error Rate**: Failed operations due to navigation
4. **Time Complexity**: Calls required per operation

### Control Variables
- Identical datasets for both navigators
- Same MCP protocol implementation
- Consistent test scenarios via seeding
- No caching or optimization tricks

## Methodology

### Test Scenario Generation
```
1. Enumerate all possible operations from dataset
2. Categorize by type and complexity
3. Use seeded random selection for reproducibility
4. Ensure balanced representation of operation types
```

### Measurement Protocol
```
For each test scenario:
1. Reset both navigators to initial state
2. Execute identical operations on both
3. Count tool calls for each navigator
4. Record success/failure status
5. Calculate efficiency ratio
```

### Statistical Analysis
- **Mean Efficiency Gain**: Average across all tests
- **Standard Deviation**: Consistency of results
- **Correlation Analysis**: Efficiency vs complexity
- **Operation Type Breakdown**: Gains by category

## Expected Outcomes

### Quantitative Predictions
```
Test Dataset (n=31):
- FSM: ~3.5 calls/operation
- Petri: ~1.0 calls/operation
- Efficiency: 3.5x

Standard Dataset (n=113):
- FSM: ~3.8 calls/operation
- Petri: ~1.2 calls/operation
- Efficiency: 3.2x

Chaos Dataset (n=139):
- FSM: ~4.2 calls/operation
- Petri: ~1.5 calls/operation
- Efficiency: 2.8x
```

### Qualitative Expectations
1. FSM will fail "quick access" scenarios requiring direct state updates
2. Petri net will handle concurrent operations naturally
3. Semantic operations will show largest efficiency gains
4. Special characters in states will not affect Petri net performance

## Threats to Validity

### Internal Validity
- **Selection Bias**: Random test selection mitigates cherry-picking
- **Implementation Bias**: Both navigators use same core libraries
- **Measurement Bias**: Automated counting eliminates human error

### External Validity
- **Dataset Representativeness**: Three datasets cover different complexity levels
- **Workflow Realism**: Based on actual enterprise patterns
- **Tool Generalization**: MCP is emerging standard for AI agents

### Construct Validity
- **Efficiency Metric**: Tool calls directly correlate with API costs and latency
- **Operation Categories**: Match real user workflows
- **Complexity Measures**: State count and transition density are standard metrics

## Ethical Considerations

1. **Reproducibility**: All code and data openly available (GPL-3.0)
2. **Transparency**: No proprietary algorithms or hidden optimizations
3. **Practical Impact**: Results directly applicable to reducing AI agent costs

## Evaluation Criteria

### Success Metrics
1. Consistent efficiency gains across datasets (H1 confirmed)
2. Scaling pattern matches predictions (H2 confirmed)
3. Operation type analysis shows expected patterns (H3 confirmed)
4. Results reproducible with different seeds

### Failure Conditions
- Efficiency gain < 2x would challenge core hypothesis
- Inconsistent results across datasets would indicate methodology issues
- High error rates would suggest implementation problems

## Future Research Directions

1. **Distributed Workflows**: Multiple agents sharing Petri net state
2. **Learning Effects**: Can agents discover semantic shortcuts?
3. **Hybrid Approaches**: Combining FSM and Petri net patterns
4. **Real-World Validation**: Testing with production workflows

## Conclusion

This experimental design provides rigorous comparison of navigation paradigms while maintaining practical relevance. The methodology ensures reproducible results that directly inform AI agent architecture decisions.
