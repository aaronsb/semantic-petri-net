# Semantic Petri Net Research Paper

A research paper documenting the discovery that enterprise workflows naturally follow Petri net patterns, based on insights from building the Targetprocess MCP Server.

## Overview

While building semantic workflow tools for AI agents, we discovered that enterprise workflows are fundamentally concurrent, multi-entry systems that align with Petri net theory rather than the finite state machine models typically used in AI agent design.

## Key Insights

- **Semantic Hints Pattern**: Tools that provide contextual guidance enable natural workflow navigation
- **Multi-Entry Workflows**: Real enterprise processes don't have single starting points
- **Role-Based Adaptation**: Different stakeholders need different interaction patterns
- **Theoretical Alignment**: These patterns naturally map to Petri net concepts
